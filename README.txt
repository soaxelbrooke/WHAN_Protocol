This is the protocol for the EE 542 WHAN project.

Contact Stuart at stuart.owen@gmail.com for deets.

WHAN Protocol files are:
    address_book.c/h
    message.h
    my.c/h
    whan_protocol.c/h

Lightbulb example files are:
    light_control.c/h
    light_timer.c/h
    main.c

I highly recommend checking out the example implemented for the lightbulb 
example, if not using it as a skeleton for your own project.
